                    <div class="conclusion-content">
                        <p>Paula has had a worldwide influence on graphic design, mainly through her bold, innovative approach to typography and branding. As covered, she is known for her expressive fonts, making typography the main element in her designs, especially in her poster work. Her work for major brands like Citibank and Microsoft, along with her iconic designs for the Public Theatre, has set new standards in design. Her ability to use oversized type, vibrant colour schemes, and layouts, has inspired many designers to think more creatively. Paula is a personal favourite, as she has a talent in combining creativity with practicality. What stands out to me is her approach to design, whether itâs challenging traditional rules or using oversized typography to transform spaces, she consistently pushes limits. Her work with big brands demonstrates how design can be visually appealing. I feel I will always look at Paula's work for inspiration, especially when working with typographic hierarchy in future projects.</p>
